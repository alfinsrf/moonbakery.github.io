## ðŸ“ŒInformation
This is the website of Moon Bakery. This is my personal project to deepen and also improve my skills in the front-end field. I created this website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

I made this website to be responsive to view from any device from mobile to Desktop. In this MoonBakery website I created several sections from hero, about, menu, testimonial, product, to contact. In the testimonial section I use Owl Carousel so that the testimonials can be scrolled properly. I also use the scroll reveal package to give a dynamic impression to the images and text on the website.

This bakery website has a product section where users can make purchases by adding products to the cart. I use Alpine JS to create data from each product and display it dynamically in html. There is also a payment system on this website that I use using Midtrans, I implement it using PHP.

Note: The transaction system using midtrans here is only a demo and because I deployed this website using GitHub page, the midtrans system is not running.
